# i2p-ssh-config

[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/eyedeekay/i2p-ssh-config.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/eyedeekay/i2p-ssh-config)

Requires: [i2pd 2.21](https://github.com/purplei2p/i2pd/) and [genmkfile](https://github.com/whonix/genmkfile/)

Optionally can be used with: [samcatd](https://github.com/eyedeekay/sam-forwarder) and [java-i2p](https://geti2p.net), but
compatibility is momentarily limited due to the current shortcomings of samcatd.

Proof-of-Concept for an apt-installable ssh-over-i2p configuration using i2pd's
new tunnels.conf.d folder. It consists of an alternate set of configuration
files for OpenSSH and i2pd that automatically configures the sshd with fresh,
i2p-only keys, only on the localhost, on port 7622. Then it forwards that new
SSH service to the i2p network. All automatically. It doesn't have all the
features I want it to yet, but I've tried it and it works.

It runs a totally separate sshd, with different keys than the default sshd.
Since it depends on sshd being installed, which means that if you don't have
OpenSSH already configured then you'll end up with a new, running sshd.

The larger point is that with the use of /etc/i2pd/tunnels.conf.d instead of a
single monolithic tunnels.conf file, it becomes possible to express the
configuration of a service that you wish to forward to i2p as an easy-to-install
and easy-to create package. In this case it's OpenSSH sshd, but it could be any
service that could benefit from being routed using sshd.

Getting genmkfile from Whonix
- -----------------------------

genmkfile is pretty awesome for deterministically encapsulating configuration.

  1. Add [Whonix's Signing Key](https://www.whonix.org/wiki/Whonix_Signing_Key).

```sh
    sudo apt-key --keyring /etc/apt/trusted.gpg.d/whonix.gpg adv --keyserver hkp://ipv4.pool.sks-keyservers.net:80 --recv-keys 916B8D99C38EAF5E8ADC7A2A8D66066A2EEACCDA
```

  2. Add Whonix's APT repository.

```sh
echo "deb http://deb.whonix.org stretch main" | sudo tee /etc/apt/sources.list.d/whonix.list
```

  3. Update your package lists.

```sh
sudo apt-get update
```

  4. Install `genmkfile`.

```sh
sudo apt-get install genmkfile
```

Building the package yourself
- -----------------------------

If you have debuild and make installed, you can build the experimental package
by running

```sh
make deb
```
